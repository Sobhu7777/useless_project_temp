# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Attack on Snacks]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [A S SOBHRAJ] - [GEC Sreekrishnapuram]
- Member 2: [UVAIS J] - [GEC Sreekrishnapuram]

### Project Description
[Thatukkada Mood Scanner is a quirky, Kerala-themed web app that detects your mood from a selfie using AI-powered face and emotion recognition. Based on your vibe, it serves up Text-To-Speech(TTsModel) over-the-top snack horoscopes, reincarnation predictions, and even dramatic snack death prophecies ‚Äî all wrapped in a nostalgic thattukada aesthetic.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People are walking around tragically unaware of what snack their mood truly embodies ‚Äî a crisis in the making. Without proper snack-based prophecies, humanity risks eating the wrong vada at the wrong time, misinterpreting emotional chaya signals, and completely missing out on their spiritually destined thattukada fate. We‚Äôre here to fix the world‚Äôs most pointless, yet deeply urgent, snack‚Äìemotion alignment crisis.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We built Thatukkada Mood Scanner, the only app brave enough to combine cutting-edge AI emotion detection with completely unscientific snack prophecies. Using face detection and emotion analysis, our virtual thattukada legend judge your face harder than your auntie at a wedding. Then, with the wisdom of a thousand banana fritters, we deliver your Snack Horoscope, Snack Reincarnation, and Snack Death Prediction ‚Äî all accompanied by overly dramatic TTS narration, tacky animations, and background music that feels like a tea shop in 1998.]
